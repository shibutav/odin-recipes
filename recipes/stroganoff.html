  <h1>Brazilian Stroganoff</h1>
  <img src="/images/bst.jpg" alt="Image of stroganoff" height="310" width="450">
  <p>Brazilian stroganoff, also known as "Estrogonofe de Carne" in Portuguese, is a popular dish in Brazil that has its roots in the classic Russian beef stroganoff but has been adapted to suit Brazilian tastes. It's a hearty and creamy dish typically made with tender strips of beef, onions, mushrooms, and sometimes diced tomatoes, all cooked in a creamy sauce made with ketchup, mustard, and heavy cream.</p>
  <p>The Brazilian version often includes white rice as a side dish, and it's not uncommon to find it served with shoestring potatoes or potato sticks on top for added texture and flavor. Some variations may also include ham or bacon for extra richness. It's a comforting and flavorful meal that is commonly enjoyed in Brazilian households and restaurants alike.</p>
