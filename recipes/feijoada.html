  <p>Feijoada is a traditional Brazilian stew that is often considered the national dish of Brazil. It's a hearty and flavorful dish made with black beans and a variety of meats, typically pork or beef, and is often served with rice, collard greens, orange slices, and farofa (toasted cassava flour).</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <uL>
    <li>500g black beans, dried or canned</li>
    <li>500g assorted meats (such as pork ribs, bacon, sausage, and beef)</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>If using dried black beans, soak them in water overnight. Drain and rinse before using.
        <li>In a large pot, combine the black beans, assorted meats, chopped onion, minced garlic, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover the ingredients by about 2 inches.
        Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for about 2-3 hours or until the beans are tender and the meats are cooked through and tender. If using a pressure cooker, cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>As the feijoada cooks, skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.
        Once the feijoada is cooked, remove the bay leaves and discard.
        Serve the feijoada hot with cooked white rice, saut√©ed collard greens, orange slices, and farofa on the side.</li>
