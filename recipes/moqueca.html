  <p>Moqueca is a flavorful Brazilian fish stew made with fish, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, coconut milk, and palm oil (dendê). It's a traditional dish from the northeastern region of Brazil, but it's enjoyed throughout the country.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <uL>
    <li>500g firm white fish fillets (such as cod, tilapia, or halibut), cut into chunks</li>
    <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>1 bell pepper (red or green), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>In a large pot or deep skillet, heat the palm oil over medium heat.
        Add the sliced onion, diced tomatoes, sliced bell pepper, and minced garlic to the pot. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        Season the fish chunks with salt, pepper, and lime juice. <li>Add the seasoned fish to the pot and gently stir to combine with the vegetables.
        Pour the coconut milk over the fish and vegetables. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let the moqueca simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the flavors have melded together.
        Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or lime juice if needed.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chopped cilantro over the moqueca before serving.
        Serve hot with cooked white rice and farofa on the side, if desired.</li>
